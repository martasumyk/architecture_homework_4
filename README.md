In this himework we build a simple microservices-based system using: two services that communicate with each other and a logging and alert system.

## Task 1

Every time something happens (like a message being sent), we save a log. I use built-in Python tools and write logs into .txt file in a folder called logs/.

For example, when Service 1 sends a message or when Service 2 receives a message or when a background task starts or finishes - logs help us understand what happened and when â€” like a history of the system.
